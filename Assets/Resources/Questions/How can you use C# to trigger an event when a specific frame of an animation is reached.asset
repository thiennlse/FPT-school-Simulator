  question: How can you use C# to trigger an event when a specific frame of an animation
    is reached?

  answers:
  - Attach a script to the Animator component with a method for the frame.
  - Use a Coroutine to check the animation frame continuously.
  - Create a custom animation controller to handle frame-based events.
  - Utilize the AnimationEvents class to handle frame-specific events.
