  question: What is a key feature of coroutines in Unity and how does it contribute
    to the execution of tasks?
  category: PRU211
  answers:
  - Coroutines allow asynchronous execution useful for tasks over time like animations
    or delays.
  - Coroutines are exclusive to editor-based tasks and don't affect runtime.
  - Coroutines are specifically designed for CPU-intensive operations.
  - Coroutines execute synchronously ensuring immediate task completion.
